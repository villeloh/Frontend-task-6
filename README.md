    * some help:
        * Prevent normal link action: https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/event_preventdefault.asp
        * Get the image url form the href attribute of 'a' element
        * Rememeber that you can select the 'a' elements only when they exist. That is when fetch is complete.
        * One example: https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_modal_images.asp
        * If you want to show off, try animate.css library: https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/
